Triglav has three heads because he governs three realms: Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. The biographer Herbord states that the main Szczecin shrines were built using special art and mastery, with carvings of people and birds on the outside and inside. According to the customs of old, this shrine was a place to gather the conquered treasures and weapons of their enemies. A three-headed idol stood in this hall portraying three heads on a torso. It was called Triglav (Triglaus). A black horse with a richly decorated saddle is also dedicated to Triglav. He was taken care of by a priest of one of the temples which was used to prophesy, as Herbord describes. A folk myth from the 19th century is probably related to the cult of Triglav. The myth reads that you can see a beautiful black horse grazing in the moonlight on Midsummer's night, but the horse will disappear if someone approaches it.

Triglav has three heads because he governs three realms: Heaven, Earth, and the Underworld. The biographer Herbord states that the main Szczecin shrines were built using special art and mastery, with carvings of people and birds on the outside and inside. According to the customs of old, this shrine was a place to gather the conquered treasures and weapons of their enemies. A three-headed idol stood in this hall portraying three heads on a torso. It was called Triglav (Triglaus). A black horse with a richly decorated saddle is also dedicated to Triglav. He was taken care of by a priest of one of the temples which was used to prophesy, as Herbord describes. A folk myth from the 19th century is probably related to the cult of Triglav. The myth reads that you can see a beautiful black horse grazing in the moonlight on Midsummer's night, but the horse will disappear if someone approaches it.

Chodové were free people, only the king was above them. They traveled widely throughout the mountains of Šumava as part of their unique charge and rare freedom, often using these axes. They bred special dogs to help accomplish this goal - especially the Bohemian Shepherd (or Chodský pes) which some sources suggest is ancestral to the modern German Shepherd.For over three centuries, the terms of the Chodové agreement with the Bohemian monarchy held until the late 17th century when a German aristocrat W. M. Laminger von Albenreuth, declared the agreement void - seeking to contain and undermine the autonomy of Chodové. The Chodové revolted in 1695.

It is an English illuminated psalter of about 1200, with some extra sheets with tinted drawings added around 1250. It is the oldest surviving psalter used at Westminster Abbey. It joined the Old Royal Library as part of the collection of John Theyer, bought by Charles II of England in 1678. Both campaigns of decoration, both the illuminations of the original and the interpolated full-page drawings, are important examples of English manuscript painting from their respective periods.","price":15.00,"size":"['BLUNT', 'SHARP+22.00']","category":7,"image_url":"https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/9n835kwi/89072.jpg","image":"89072.jpg","more_images_url":"['https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/9n835kwi/89072.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/8juqkjn9/89073.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/90cppm1x/89074.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/b7p6jl0d/89075.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/bpc31xbv/89076.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/9hl8zgnl/89077.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/28obn752/89078.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/br3hrnu7/89079.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/5kyb2mat/89080.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/cilrqs6n/89081.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/7ddp5o2n/89082.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/8gukvrb9/89083.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/awde5uav/89084.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/5jfeazt5/89085.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/d9mocbj8/89086.jpg']","more_images":"['89072.jpg', '89073.jpg', '89074.jpg', '89075.jpg', '89076.jpg', '89077.jpg', '89078.jpg', '89079.jpg', '89080.jpg', '89081.jpg', '89082.jpg', '89083.jpg', '89084.jpg', '89085.jpg', '89086.jpg']"}},{"pk":"224","model":"products.product","fields":{"sku":"MSW230","name":"FERRANT, medieval broadsword, 14th century","description":"Single-handed Medieval Sword handmade by Arma Epona Smithy, swordsmakers of high quality weapons.

Rune of concentration of things in a static or frozen state. Detailed design Quality print Printed in the Czech Republic T-shirt by Gildan, USA Naav fashion brand Rune of stillness and the Ego-self. It governs: Development of concentration, will and focus Halting of unwanted dynamic forces as an act of self-defense (ard against demonic influences) Basic ego integration within a balanced multiversal system Power of control and constraint over other wights (entities), emotional outbursts Focus of the will into single-minded action Although ice generally  shows itself as it is, with little glamor, there is little so  treacherous as a weak spot in the ice, that will swallow the unwary  with surprising swiftness, and soon enough leave hardly a trace. The  hidden part of an iceberg, which represents 90% of its bulk, can remain  hidden and gut a ship with little mercy. This rune is yet another rune  that represents an aspect of the harshness of reality. Isa will control and quiet emotional distress, but be wary! It will not eliminate any persistent root cause of unpleasant circumstance. But it can help in extending stillness into your aura. Isa is particularly useful in attaining stillness of presence.","price":22.00,"size":"['S', 'M', 'L', 'XL', 'XXL+1.80', 'XXXL+1.80', 'XXXXL+1.80']","category":12,"image_url":"https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/3tlpiph7/35558.jpg","image":"35558.jpg","more_images_url":"['https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/3tlpiph7/35558.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/oen3f47v/12412.jpg', 'https://i00.eu/img/602/300x300/a6mvz4s9/35559.jpg']","more_images":"['35558.jpg', '12412.jpg', '35559.jpg']"}},{"pk":"524","model":"products.product","fields":{"sku":"TTS570","name":"MEDUSA, ladies' t-shirt, colored","description":"AGAINST ALL, ladies T-Shirt, coloured, Naav.
